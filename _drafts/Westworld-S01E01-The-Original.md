西部世界

第一季 第一集

把她唤醒<br>
Bring her back online.

听得到我说话吗<br>
Can you hear me?

是的<br>
Yes.

抱歉 我感觉不太好<br>
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.

去掉口音<br>
You can lose the accent.

你知道你身在何处吗<br>
Do you know where you are?

我在梦里<br>
I'm in a dream.

没错 德洛丽丝 你在梦里<br>
That's right, Dolores. You're in a dream.

你想从梦里醒来吗<br>
Would you like to wake up from this dream?

是的<br>
Yes.

我很害怕<br>
I'm terrified.

没什么可怕的 德洛丽丝<br>
There's nothing to be afraid of, Dolores,

只要你答对我的问题就可以了<br>
As long as you answer my questions correctly.

-明白了吗 -是的<br>
\- Understand? - Yes.

很好<br>
Good.

第一个问题<br>
First...

你是否质疑过你眼中现实世界的本质<br>
Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?

没有<br>
No.

告诉我 你对你的世界的看法<br>
Tell us what you think of your world.

有人选择看到这个世界上的丑恶<br>
Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world.

那些无秩序的混乱<br>
The disarray.

我选择看到美好<br>
I choose to see the beauty.

早上好 爸爸 睡得好吗<br>
Morning, daddy. You sleep well?

很好<br>
Well enough.

你要出去写生吗<br>
You headed out to set down some of this natural splendor?

是的<br>
Thought I might.

我相信我们的生命有着某种秩序<br>
To believe there is an order to our days,

某个目标<br>
A purpose.

你对客人有什么看法<br>
What do you think of the guests?

你是说新住民吗<br>
You mean the newcomers?

第一次来的时候我全程扮个好人<br>
Now, the first time I played it white hat.

我家人也一起来了<br>
My family was here.

我们一起去钓鱼 去山里淘金<br>
We went fishing, did the gold hunt in the mountains.

-上次呢 -一个人来的<br>
\- And last time? - I came alone.

变身大魔头<br>
Went straight evil.

那是我一生中最棒的两个星期<br>
It was the best two weeks of my life.

我记得父亲对我的教导<br>
I like to remember what my father taught me.

在某个时刻<br>
That at one point or another,

我们都是这个世界的新住民<br>
we were all new to this world.

那些新住民跟我们一样 只是为了寻找<br>
The newcomers are just looking for the same thing we are--

一个自由的地方<br>
A place to be free

一个可以界定梦境<br>
to stake out our dreams,

有着无限可能的地方<br>
a place with unlimited possibilities.

老天 这真是太不可思议了<br>
Oh, god, it's incredible.

当然要物超所值<br>
Better be for what we're paying.

心狠手辣的杀人犯赫克托·艾斯卡顿<br>
Murderous son of a bitch named Hector Escaton

枪杀了警察局长<br>
gunned down the marshal.

躲去山里了<br>
He's holed up in the mountains.

你<br>
You there.

你看起来是个有勇气的小伙子<br>
You look like the kind of man who'd put his mettle to it.

今天可不行 治安官 抱歉<br>
Not today, sheriff. Apologies.

黑麦威士忌<br>
Rye whiskey.

干嘛<br>
What about it?

装在瓶子里没人喝也没什么用<br>
Well, it ain't doing any good sitting in that bottle.

你是新来的<br>
You're new.

细皮嫩肉的<br>
Not much of a rind on you.

给你打个折吧<br>
I'll give you a discount.

无意冒犯 不过<br>
Well, no offense, but...

我更情愿赢得女士的芳心 而不是花钱买<br>
I'd rather earn a woman's affection than pay for it.

爱情总归是要花钱的 亲爱的<br>
You're always paying for it, darling.

区别在于 我们的收费<br>
The difference is our costs

是明码标价挂在门前的<br>
are fixed and posted right there on the door.

你觉得你的世界里有矛盾吗<br>
Do you ever feel inconsistences in your world?

有反复吗<br>
Or repetitions?

每个生命都有其特定的轨道<br>
All lives have routine.

我的并没有什么不同<br>
Mine's no different.

然而 我总是止不住好奇<br>
Still, I never cease to wonder at the thought

会不会有那么一天 一次机缘巧合<br>
that any day the course of my whole life

就会改变我整个人生的方向<br>
could change with just one chance encounter.

别管我<br>
Don't mind me.

只是想表现下骑士风度<br>
Just trying to look chivalrous.

你回来了<br>
You came back.

我说过我会回来的<br>
I told you I would.

我能送你回家吗<br>
Can I see you home?

那得看你跟不跟得上了<br>
Well, that all depends. Can you keep up?

我还得去牵我的马<br>
Well, I have to fetch my horse.

那你最好快一点<br>
Better fetch him fast.

景色真美<br>
That's a beautiful sight.

一直不明白<br>
Never understood how you

你怎么能让它们都往一个方向走<br>
keep them all headed in the same direction.

我忘了你是一个光装相<br>
I forget you dress like a cowboy,

不放牛的牛仔<br>
but that's about the extent of it.

看见那头了吗<br>
See that one?

-嗯 -那是头牛<br>
\- Yeah. - That's the Judas Steer.

你让它去哪儿 牛群都会跟着过去<br>
Rest will follow wherever you make him go.

你是怎么把它选出来的<br>
How do you pick him out?

知道点技巧罢了<br>
Just know these things.

就像我还知道你一定会回来的<br>
Same as I knew you'd be back.

你是说我很好猜<br>
You saying I'm predictable?

每个人都有自己的路<br>
There's a path for everyone.

你的路指引你回到我身边<br>
Your path leads you back to me.

我知道万物皆有定数<br>
I know things will work out the way they're meant to.

就像我还知道爸爸看到你会不高兴<br>
Same as I know my daddy still won't be happy to see you.

父亲不会这么晚让它们在外边乱跑的<br>
Father wouldn't let them roam this close to dark.

待着别动 德洛丽丝<br>
Stay put, Dolores.

你这里除了牛奶<br>
Ain't you got anything out here

就没有别的了吗 老头<br>
other than milk, old man?

动手吧<br>
Go ahead.

我不急着去见阎王<br>
I'm in no rush to meet my judgment,

但我很清楚你将面临的下场 你这混...<br>
but I'm more sure of the outcome than you, you son of a--

那就是只有牛奶了<br>
Nothing but milk, then.

真可惜 我们都没来得及上<br>
Shame of it is you killed the old woman

你就把那老女人杀了<br>
before any of us could have a turn.

我看她还暖和着呢<br>
I reckon she's still warm enough.

没人会说三道四的<br>
Nobody gonna judge you for it.

该死 该死 该死<br>
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

最后一个问题 德洛丽丝<br>
Last question, Dolores.

如果我告诉你 你是错的呢<br>
What if I told you that you were wrong?

这里没有什么机缘巧合<br>
That there are no chance encounters?

你 和你熟知的每一个人<br>
That you and everyone you know

都是被创造出来为那些<br>
were built to gratify the desires

花钱来到你们世界的人们满足欲求的<br>
of the people who pay to visit your world?

爸爸<br>
Daddy!

爸爸<br>
Daddy!

爸爸 不<br>
Daddy! No!

那些人被你叫做"新住民"<br>
The people you call "The newcomers."

又见面了<br>
Hello again.

你爸爸这么快就放弃了<br>
Your daddy gave it up quickly.

感觉他越来越差劲了<br>
Think he's losing his touch.

你就要随他而去了 你这混蛋<br>
You'll be following right behind him, you son of a bitch.

这就是你对待老朋友的方式吗<br>
Is that any way to treat an old friend?

我来这里反复三十年了<br>
I've been coming here for 30 years,

但是你依然不记得我 是不是<br>
but you still don't remember me, do you?

我们一起经历过那么多<br>
After all we've been through.

他们给你增加了点勇气 德洛丽丝<br>
They gave you a little more pluck, Dolores.

真是太迷人了<br>
Absolutely charming.

别用你的脏手碰她<br>
Take your hands off her.

泰迪<br>
Oh, Teddy.

学了什么新招数吗<br>
Any special tricks for us?

他们教了你坐直 还是作揖讨食<br>
They teach you to sit up, beg?

不如我让你先开枪吧<br>
How about I give you the first shot, hmm?

毕竟 落水狗也有翻身的时候<br>
After all, every dog has his day.

你的嘴巴倒是动得挺快<br>
Well, your mouth move fast enough.

不知你的枪如何<br>
How about your gun?

如果我告诉你 你不能伤害新住民<br>
What if I told you that you can't hurt the newcomers?

而他们可以对你为所欲为呢<br>
And that they can do anything they want to you?

我从不明白他们为什么要把你们配成一对<br>
I never understood why they paired some of you off.

看起来挺残酷的<br>
Seems cruel.

然后我明白了<br>
And then I realized

胜利要建立在有人输的基础上才有意义<br>
winning doesn't mean anything unless someone else loses.

也就是说 你注定要成为输家<br>
Which means you're here to be the loser.

我来帮你一把吧 孩子<br>
Let me help you, son.

看起来你不是你以为的那种人<br>
Seems you're not the man you thought you were.

来吧 美人<br>
Come on, beautiful.

不不 不要<br>
Oh, no! No!

泰迪 泰迪<br>
Teddy! Teddy!

不不不 求你别伤害他<br>
No, no, no, please don't hurt him.

你要我做什么我都愿意<br>
I'll do whatever you say.

我花这么多钱可不是为了简简单单取胜<br>
I didn't pay all this money 'cause I want it easy.

我想要你反抗<br>
I want you to fight.

不准碰她<br>
Don't you touch her!

天杀的 回来这里的感觉真棒<br>
God damn, feels good to be back.

咱们去庆祝吧<br>
Let's celebrate.

不 不要<br>
No! Don't!

不 不<br>
Oh, no, no!

不要<br>
No!

我告诉你的这些事<br>
Would the things I told you

有没有让你改变对新住民的看法 德洛丽丝<br>
change the way you think about the newcomers, Dolores?

不要<br>
No!

没有<br>
No.

当然没有<br>
Of course not.

我们都喜爱新住民<br>
We all love the newcomers.

我遇到的每个新的人<br>
Every new person I meet

都提醒着我 能活着是多么幸运<br>
reminds me how lucky I am to be alive...

这个世界是多么美好<br>
...and how beautiful this world can be.

天啊 他们可真鲜活<br>
Oh, my god, they're so lifelike.

看看那个 他简直完美<br>
Look at that one. He's perfect.

完美等于无聊<br>
Perfect is boring.

我对坏人更感兴趣<br>
I'm more interested in the bad guys.

看到了吗<br>
Did you see it?

没有<br>
No.

再等等 她还会重复<br>
Give it a second. She'll do it again.

她的手指 那不是标准配置手势<br>
Her finger. That's not standard.

我昨晚就注意到了<br>
I noticed it last night.

于是去查了更新文件<br>
Went looking in the update.

是一套新型的手势<br>
It's a whole new class of gestures.

可如果不是我们设置的 那会是谁<br>
But if we didn't put it there, then who did?

福特 他在我们发布更新前还是会一一检查<br>
Ford. He still reviews every update before we issue them.

肯定是他没告诉别人偷偷加进去的<br>
He must have slipped it in there without telling anyone.

他管那叫"冥思"<br>
He calls them "Reveries."

以前的手势只是一般的动作<br>
The old gestures were just generic movements.

-这些是绑定了特定记忆的 -怎么可能<br>
\- These are tied to specific memories. - How?

记忆会在每个叙事环结束后被清除<br>
The memories are purged at the end of every narrative loop.

但数据还在 等着被覆盖重写<br>
But they're still in there, waiting to be overwritten.

他找到了方法对它们进行提取<br>
He found a way to access them,

就像某种潜意识<br>
Like a subconscious.

一个有深度的妓女<br>
A hooker with hidden depths?

所有男人的梦想啊<br>
Every man's dream.

就是这些小细节让他们显得真实<br>
It's the tiny things that make them seem real,

让游客爱上他们<br>
That make the guests fall in love with them.

失陪<br>
Excuse me.

出问题了吗<br>
We have a problem?

我们监测到某种非既定活动<br>
We have some unscheduled activity.

显然 你的一个作品不太安分<br>
Evidently, one of your creatures is restless.

在园区里吗<br>
In the park?

不 在冷藏库 地下83层<br>
No, sublevel 83, cold storage.

我们该谨慎处理<br>
We should be cautious.

派个应急小队过去 要全副武装<br>
Send a response team, full armor.

我会亲自去处理<br>
I'll take care of it myself.

我觉得你们跟游客一样享受换装<br>
I think you guys enjoy playing dress up as much as the guests.

接待员没法伤害你们 设定就是如此<br>
The hosts can't hurt you by design.

你家里没有孩子吧 伯纳德<br>
You don't have kids at home, do you, Bernard?

没有<br>
No.

要是你有 你就会知道他们早晚都会叛逆<br>
If you did, you'd know that they all rebel eventually.

你得原谅他们可能有点紧张过度<br>
You'll forgive them for being a little uptight.

每次你的团队运行一次更新<br>
Every time your team rolls out an update,

都有出现重大故障的可能性<br>
there's a possibility of a critical failure.

我们又不会更新冷藏库里的接待员<br>
We don't update the hosts in cold storage.

园区也有三十年没出现过重大故障了<br>
And the park hasn't had a critical failure in over 30 years.

早该出故障了<br>
Meaning we're overdue.

我也去 如果是我的作品 我也许能帮上忙<br>
I'll go along, too. If it's one of mine, I might be able to help.

他们正常运作的时候才是你的 伯尼<br>
They're only yours until they stop working, Bernie.

否则他们就是我的<br>
Then they're mine.

地下83层

制冷系统已经坏了几周了<br>
Cooling system's been down for weeks.

气味肯定不错 我建议你退后点<br>
Gonna smell fantastic. I recommend you hang back.

他们什么时候会修好<br>
When are they gonna fix this?

牲畜管理部门还有其他更重要的事<br>
Livestock management's got other priorities.

而且<br>
Besides...

这里又没人抱怨<br>
No one's complained.

祝酒词

敬穿白鞋的女士<br>
Here's to the lady with the white shoes.

卷走了所有的钱 还喝光了所有的酒<br>
Take all your money, drink all your booze.

别<br>
Stop.

除非你打算把老板也废了<br>
Unless you plan to decommission the boss.

没能守身如玉 那算不上罪过<br>
Ain't got a cherry, that ain't no sin.

至少身子还在<br>
She's still got the box that the cherry come in.

我要为此喝一杯<br>
I'll drink to that.

辛辣酒<br>
The old coffin varnish.

西部酒吧用威士忌与松节油/氨水/火药/辣椒粉调的重口酒

他们现在已经不做了<br>
They don't make that like they used to.

现在什么都比不上从前了<br>
They don't make anything like they used to.

没错 人也一样<br>
Damn right. Men neither.

我当年看过几次决战<br>
I've seen a few showdowns in my day.

可比你想的还多<br>
More than you know.

我们为穿白鞋的女士干一杯吧<br>
Shall we drink to the lady with the white shoes?

我们还是为了<br>
Perhaps we better drink to a...

一夜无梦的沉睡干一杯吧<br>
Deep and dreamless slumber.

老比尔总是个很好的倾听者<br>
Old Bill here was always a good listener.

他是我们造的第二个接待员<br>
He was the second host we ever built.

那时候你来了吗 伯纳德<br>
Were you with us in those days, Bernard,

还是在你来之前了<br>
Or was that before your time?

恐怕大部分都在我来之前就被废弃了<br>
Most were decommissioned before I was brought on, I'm afraid.

他们一直自我重复 经常坏掉<br>
They repeated themselves, broke down constantly.

一次简单的握手就能让他们暴露本质<br>
A simple handshake would give them away.

你还会把自己放好吧 比尔<br>
You'll put yourself away again, won't you, Bill?

我看到了新的手势 冥思<br>
I saw the new gestures, the reveries.

很优美<br>
They're beautiful.

你这一路来作出的成就<br>
The distance you've traveled from then till now,

很了不起<br>
It's remarkable.

算得上是吧<br>
Yeah, that's a word for it.

早上好 爸爸 睡得好吗<br>
Morning, daddy. You sleep well?

很好<br>
Well enough.

你要出去写生吗<br>
You headed out to set down some of this natural splendor?

是的<br>
Thought I might.

当然得等我放完牛<br>
After my errands, of course.

天黑前回来<br>
See you home before dark.

那个枪杀了警察局长的强盗<br>
That bandit who gunned down the

还藏在山里<br>
marshal is still hiding up there in the hills.

我已经不是小孩子了 没事的<br>
I'm not a child anymore. I'll be just fine.

我当差的时候<br>
When I was a law man--

没错 爸爸 我知道所有你当差时的事<br>
Yes, daddy, I know all about when you were a law man.

我和所有想追我的男孩子<br>
I know all your stories and

都知道你的那些故事<br>
so does every boy that ever came courting.

我知道他们是怎么想的 我也年轻过<br>
I know how boys think. Was one myself once.

经常各种酗酒闹事<br>
Given to all manner of drinking and mischief.

那个无法无天的男孩去哪了<br>
Whatever happened to that fearsome ne'er-do-well?

他在我成为你父亲的那天消失了<br>
He vanished the day I became your father.

是你造就了今天的我<br>
I am what I am because of you,

我也不想成为别的样子<br>
and I wouldn't have it any other way.

我知道 爸爸<br>
I know, daddy.

我会在天黑前回家<br>
I'll be home before dark.

心狠手辣的杀人犯赫克托·艾斯卡顿<br>
Murderous son of a bitch Hector Escaton

枪杀了警察局长<br>
gunned down the marshal.

他现在窝藏在山上<br>
He's now holed up in the mountains.

这位先生<br>
You there.

你看起来很有勇气<br>
You look like the kind of man who'd put his mettle to it.

你觉得呢 亲爱的<br>
What do you think, honey?

听起来很好玩<br>
Sounds fun.

你是新来的<br>
You're new.

细皮嫩肉的<br>
Not much of a rind on you.

给你打个折吧<br>
I'll give you a discount.

无意冒犯 我更情愿赢得女士的芳心<br>
No offense, but I'd rather earn a woman's affection

而不是花钱买<br>
than pay for it.

等等 等等 我认识他<br>
Wait, wait, I know that one.

泰迪<br>
Hey, Teddy.

上次过来 是这哥们带我参观的<br>
Yeah, last trip, this dude showed me around.

怎么了 泰迪<br>
What's the good word, Teddy?

多谢了<br>
Mighty kind of you.

很甜<br>
Sweet.

但不如你甜<br>
Not as sweet as you.

恐怕我今晚另有安排了 德洛丽丝<br>
I'm afraid I've got other plans tonight, Dolores.

祝你今晚愉快<br>
Have a pleasant evening.

你是新来的 细皮...<br>
You're new. Not much of a...

请下注 先生们 请下注<br>
Place your bets, gentlemen. Place your bets.

看来赫克托往这边逃了<br>
Yeah, looks like Hector's been this way.

你知道还要走多久吗<br>
Any idea how much longer this is gonna take?

我妻子不想在天黑后还在山上<br>
My wife doesn't want to be up here after dark.

我们知道他躲在山上某处<br>
We know he's up in these hills somewhere.

他肯定会狠狠和我们干上一场 等我们<br>
He's gonna put up one hell of a fight when we--

等我们 等我们<br>
When we-- when we--

治安官<br>
Sheriff?

他出毛病了 我要回镇上<br>
Something is wrong with it. I want to head back to town.

马上<br>
Now.

这他妈的什么毛病<br>
What the fuck is wrong with it?

你给他升了级<br>
You updated the guy,

现在他犯了癫痫<br>
and now he's a six-foot gourd with epilepsy.

到底他妈的怎么回事<br>
So what the fuck happened?

我不知道<br>
I don't know.

这还真是<br>
Well, that's exactly what

我想从编程部门主管嘴里听到的话呢<br>
you want to hear from your head of programming.

我们还没完成诊断<br>
We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.

很明显机器出现了异常行为<br>
Clearly it's exhibiting some aberrant behavior.

真他妈异常啊 伯尼<br>
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.

你的接待员会生病 迷路<br>
Your hosts get sick, they get lost,

但这可就奇怪了<br>
but this is grotesque.

是升级导致的问题吗<br>
Is it a problem with the update?

有可能 但可能性不大<br>
Possible, but not likely.

如果这个版本有问题<br>
If it's the unlikely version,

说说你已经升级了多少接待员<br>
how many hosts have you updated so far?

差不多10%<br>
Maybe 10% of the population.

好吧 弄清问题前把所有升级接待员收回<br>
All right, we pull all updated hosts until we can figure it out.

你他妈的在逗我吗<br>
Are you fucking kidding me?

那可是两百个接待员 涉及十几条故事线<br>
That's 200 hosts spread across a dozen active storylines.

游客们经常会打断你宝贵的故事情节<br>
The guests interrupt your precious storylines all the time

只要他们想射击或者干什么东西的时候<br>
when they want to shoot or fuck something.

不 那是他们想<br>
No, when they want to.

我们提供的是一百个相互关联的故事<br>
We sell complete immersion

沉浸式的旅程<br>
in 100 interconnected narratives.

不间断的体验<br>
A relentless fucking experience.

你抽掉一个角色 整个故事都要调整<br>
Now, you pull one character, the overall story adjusts.

一次性抽掉两百个 这他妈就是大灾难<br>
You pull 200 at once, and it's a fucking disaster!

你觉得我们要怎么做<br>
I mean, what do you propose we do?

停业吗 发礼品券吗<br>
Close down? Issue fucking gift certificates?

你的眉毛很美<br>
It's beautiful-- your brow.

当你生气却极力控制的时候 眉毛很美<br>
When you're angry but trying to control it,

肌肉活动使其形成一道弧线<br>
the fine muscles pull into a little arc.

很优美<br>
It's elegant.

我能录下来吗<br>
Would you mind if I recorded it?

我想给我的团队看看<br>
I'd love to show it to my team.

不行 伯纳德 不能录<br>
No, Bernard, you may not record it.

眉毛又动了<br>
Ah, there it is again.

园区内有1400名游客<br>
We have 1,400 guests in the park.

我需要知道他们是否有危险<br>
I need to know if they're in any danger.

他的核心程序很完整<br>
His core code is intact,

也就是说他不会伤害游客<br>
which means he can't hurt a guest.

就连一只苍蝇都不会伤害<br>
He literally couldn't hurt a fly.

他只会...<br>
All he can do is...

这么做<br>
...that.

好吧 伯尼<br>
All right, Bernie.

进行诊断<br>
Run a diagnostic.

同时 哪怕是一个<br>
In the meantime, there's so much

偏离剧本的小喷嚏 都要告诉我<br>
as an unscripted sneeze, I want to know about it.

这地方太他妈疯狂了<br>
This place is fucking wild.

这只是最基本的<br>
This is basic.

第一级<br>
Level one.

你出城后<br>
You ride out of town,

真正的疯狂才刚刚开始<br>
that's when the real demented shit begins.

那时我朋友泰迪就会登场<br>
That's where my man Teddy comes in.

他就像个导游<br>
He's like a guide.

老实说<br>
Honestly,

那家伙让我感觉有点恐怖<br>
the guy kind of creeps me out.

管他的 等他带我们出了峡谷<br>
Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons,

无聊的时候就拿他当靶子练枪好了<br>
we get bored, we just use him for target practice.

我们不应该过河吧<br>
I don't think we're supposed to be cross the river.

雅各布还太小<br>
It's too adult for Jacob.

我们无意打扰您<br>
We didn't mean to bother you.

不算打扰 这里景色很美<br>
No bother at all. It's a beautiful spot.

我一直觉得不该一个人独享<br>
I always found it a shame that I have it all to myself.

它们每天都会来<br>
They come here every day.

你想靠近点看吗<br>
Would you like a closer look?

别怕 它们很温顺的<br>
Don't be scared. They're very gentle.

给你 手掌摊平<br>
Here, put your hand out real flat.

它们很美吧<br>
They're beautiful, aren't they?

你是他们中的一员 对吧<br>
You're one of them, aren't you?

你不是真实的<br>
You're not real.

我得走了 太阳快下山了<br>
I have to go now. Sun's almost down.

你们也回吧 山里有强盗<br>
You should, too. There's bandits in these hills.

走 驾<br>
Here we go, yah! Yah!

你在等我吗 爸爸<br>
You waiting up for me, daddy?

我跟你说了我会在天黑前回来<br>
I told you I'd be home before dark.

我今天在土里发现了这个<br>
I found this in the field today.

我看不出来什么<br>
Doesn't look like anything to me.

她这是在哪里<br>
Well, where is she?

你见过这种地方吗<br>
Have you ever seen anything like this place?

我看不出来什么<br>
Doesn't look like anything to me.

我去帮妈妈准备晚饭了<br>
I'm gonna help mama put supper on.

我跟你想得一样<br>
I had the same thought.

睡觉之前得晒晒太阳<br>
Needed a little sunshine before turning in.

你下次什么时候轮班回家<br>
So, when do you get to rotate home again?

你这么不会聊天<br>
If you're this bad at writing small talk,

到底是怎么得到这份工作的<br>
How the fuck did you get your job?

说重点<br>
Get to the point.

如果之前多有冒犯 我向你道歉<br>
I wanted to apologize if I came across as aggressive.

还有我想跟你谈谈更新的事<br>
And I wanted to talk to you about the update.

问题已经解决了<br>
The problem's been resolved.

根本就不该有什么更新<br>
There should never have been an update in the first place.

福特和伯纳德一直想把他们弄得更像人类<br>
Ford and Bernard keep making the things more lifelike.

但真的有人想要这样吗<br>
But does anyone truly want that?

你想觉得<br>
Do you want to think that your

你丈夫真的在上某个漂亮女人吗<br>
husband is really fucking that beautiful girl

还是你真的射杀了某个人<br>
or that you really just shot someone?

正因为游客知道接待员不是真人<br>
This place works because the guests

这里才这么受欢迎<br>
know the hosts aren't real.

你到底想说什么<br>
So what exactly are you suggesting?

不要再升级了<br>
Stop the updates altogether.

也许还可以滚回一点<br>
Maybe even roll them back a bit.

让接待员更可控一些<br>
Make the hosts more manageable.

额叶切除手术可以做到<br>
Lobotomies tend to do that.

想想这样的好处吧<br>
Well, think of the benefits

在设计时间 维护 成本上<br>
In terms of design time, maintenance, costs.

就更不用提福特博士了<br>
Not to mention the dr. Ford factor.

这个人会追随他内心的恶魔直至地狱的深渊<br>
The guy's gonna chase his demons right over the deep end.

我比谁都要敬重他 但是在这点上...<br>
I mean, no one respects him more than me, but at some point--

我 没人比我更敬重他<br>
I. No one respects him more than I.

你的代词是第二个分句的主语<br>
Your pronoun is the subject of the second clause.

我是说<br>
I was saying-- -

你说的是我们那个无所畏惧的头儿垮了<br>
you were saying should our fearless leader have a breakdown,

你想利用这个往上爬<br>
you want to leverage it for your career.

听我说 早就应该换人了<br>
Listen, a changing of the guard is long overdue.

我想你知道 我站在你这边<br>
I just wanted you to know that you have my support

而且我知道<br>
and that I know that the

公司对这里的真正兴趣<br>
corporation's real interest in this place

远不止是满足那些<br>
goes way beyond gratifying

想扮演牛仔的有钱混蛋<br>
some rich assholes who want to play cowboy.

我原以为你只擅长<br>
And here I thought you were only good

写写下流的幻想剧情<br>
For writing depraved little fantasies.

没错<br>
You're right.

这个地方对客人是一回事<br>
This place is one thing to the guests,

对股东来说又是另一回事<br>
another thing to the shareholders,

在管理上又是完全不同的<br>
and something completely different to management.

启发启发我<br>
So enlighten me.

你觉得管理层真正的兴趣是什么<br>
What do you think management's real interests are?

你够聪明 能看到存在远景<br>
You're smart enough to guess there's a bigger picture,

但又不够聪明 看不清楚是什么<br>
but not smart enough to see what it is.

所以你知道你的支持对我来说有什么用吗<br>
You know how much use that makes your support to me?

什么用都没有<br>
Fuck all.

去睡个好觉吧 希斯摩尔先生<br>
Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.

你明天还要讨好更多的有钱混蛋呢<br>
You'll have more rich assholes to gratify tomorrow.

这么早睡吗 梅芙<br>
Early night, maeve?

身体有点不适<br>
Feeling a bit out of sorts.

克莱门汀可以接我的活<br>
Clementine can pick up the slack.

晚安<br>
Night.

忘了什么吗 基西<br>
Forgetting something, Kissy?

我开始觉得你对我有意思了<br>
I'm beginning to think you're getting sweet on me.

那是因为你身上流着一半乡巴佬的血<br>
Well, on account of you being half cornhusker.

告诉我哪一半是<br>
Tell me which half is which

我来搜搜那一半<br>
and I'll search that half.

那一半会切断你的喉咙的<br>
Yeah, the half that's gonna cut your fucking throat.

我告诉过你 我没...<br>
I told you, I didn't take--

又和新的一样了 是吗<br>
Good as new again, huh?

有时候我很羡慕你能忘记从前<br>
Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness.

有一个接待员出现了严重故障<br>
We've got a serious problem with one of the hosts.

这个人还没喝够呢<br>
Thinking this one's still thirsty.

这次不会死了 阿诺德<br>
Not gonna die this time, Arnold.

没什么能杀得了我<br>
Ain't nothing gonna kill me.

你们喝不了 这不是给你们的<br>
You can't have none. Ain't for you.

又找到一瓶<br>
Found me another bottle.

你在长个 要多喝奶<br>
You're a growing boy.

你在长个<br>
A growing boy.

在长个<br>
Growing boy!

里面有两个客人<br>
We got two guests inside.

我去跟他们谈<br>
We'll go talk to them,

你们搞定这个烂摊子<br>
you sort this mess out.

他们本就该相互攻击的<br>
You know, they're supposed to turn on each other,

但只有在客人把他们带到高能故事情节上的时候<br>
but only if a guest takes them on the high sierra storyline,

沃尔特总会配合<br>
and Walter always buys it.

看来沃尔特已经厌倦了<br>
Well, I guess Walter got tired of buying it.

这说明治安官的事不是个别事件<br>
I suppose this means the sheriff wasn't an isolated incident.

其实这是个好消息 真的<br>
It's good news, really.

证实了问题就是出自于升级<br>
Confirms the problem was part of the update.

我们可以把他们进行滚回操作<br>
We can roll them back,

清理干净 再重新上线<br>
clean them up, put them back in service.

你觉得我会同意<br>
You think I'm gonna sign off

让这个谋杀犯重新上线吗<br>
on this fucking homicidal thing going back into service?

本来的设计就是谋杀犯<br>
It's homicidal by design.

沃尔特一直都杀其他的接待员<br>
Walter kills other hosts all the time.

我承认这个模式<br>
I'll admit the method here

有点打破常规<br>
is a little unconventional,

但是它没有伤害到客人<br>
but it didn't hurt a guest.

接待员理应待在自己的循环中<br>
The hosts are supposed to stay within their loops,

按剧本行事<br>
stick to their scripts

只能有极小的即兴发挥<br>
with minor improvisations.

但这可不是极小的即兴发挥<br>
This isn't a minor improvisation.

这他妈简直是场大灾难<br>
This is a fucking shitstorm.

我们明天必须召回所有被更新的接待员<br>
We recall all remaining updated hosts tomorrow.

一个个检查 废弃掉残次品<br>
Examine them one by one, decommission the faulty ones.

那整个故事线怎么办<br>
What about narrative?

如此大规模的召回 会引发极大的混乱<br>
A recall of that size will be disruptive.

我已经让那位狂暴的朋友<br>
I've told our overstimulated friend

提前一周去洗劫酒吧<br>
to advance the saloon heist a week

并让血腥程度翻倍<br>
and make it twice as bloody.

那应该可以帮我们掩盖召回剩余接待员的行动<br>
Should give us cover to recall the remaining hosts.

客人们一定会很喜欢的<br>
And the guests will love it.

我觉得福特恐怕不会同意吧<br>
I'm not sure Ford will approve.

我也担心他不会同意<br>
I'm not sure either,

因此就由你去告诉他吧<br>
which is why you get to be the one to tell him.

这是你搞出的烂摊子 伯尼<br>
This is your fuckup, Bernie.

只有这样才公平<br>
Only seems fair.

我们的造物似乎有些行为失常<br>
So our creatures have been misbehaving,

你到现在还没把程序错误筛选出来吗<br>
and you haven't yet isolated the bug?

那可真不像你的风格 伯纳德<br>
That's so unlike you, Bernard.

当然 除非你已经解决了<br>
Unless, of course, you have

只不过是结果让你感到很丢人<br>
and are simply embarrassed by the result.

是您添加的代码出了问题 先生<br>
It's the code you added, sir.

冥思<br>
The reveries.

它有一些...<br>
It has some...

"错误"<br>
"Mistakes"

你觉得很丢人 不想用这个词<br>
Is the word you're too embarrassed to use.

不必觉得丢人<br>
You ought not to be.

你就是千万亿个错误的产物<br>
You're a product of a trillion of them.

进化形成了这个星球上有情感和知觉的生命体<br>
Evolution forged the entirety of sentient life on this planet

用的唯一的工具 就是错误<br>
using only one tool--the mistake.

我自认为<br>
I flattered myself

我们现在采取的是更专业成熟的做法<br>
we were taking a more disciplined approach here.

我猜"自欺"也是自然选择的结果吧<br>
I suppose self-delusion is a gift of natural selection as well.

确实如此<br>
Indeed it is.

不过 当然了 我们已经成功地<br>
But, of course, we've managed to

摆脱了进化的束缚 对吧<br>
slip evolution's leash now, haven't we?

我们可以治愈任何疾病<br>
We can cure any disease,

让我们当中最弱的人也能活命<br>
keep even the weakest of us alive,

或许 将来有一天<br>
and, you know, one fine day

我们甚至能让亡者复生<br>
perhaps we shall even resurrect the dead.

就像耶稣将拉撒路复活一样<br>
Call forth Lazarus from his cave.

你知道那意味着什么吗<br>
Do you know what that means?

意味着到此结束了<br>
It means that we're done.

这就是我们能取得的最好的结果了<br>
That this is as good as we're going to get.

也意味着 <br>
It also means that

你必须迁就我偶尔的错误<br>
you must indulge me the occasional mistake.

大约三公升<br>
About three liters.

那就是我给你留下的血液量<br>
That's how much blood I left in you.

失血再多一点 你就会死<br>
Lose more than that, you die.

但是眼下 你还在我掌心里<br>
But for now, you're mine.

我要从你口中问出一些答案<br>
I'm gonna get some answers out of you.

你这是要去...<br>
Where are you--

你想怎么样<br>
What do you want?

你会玩游戏吧 基西<br>
You know about games, don't you, Kissy?

这就是个复杂点的游戏<br>
Well, this is a complicated one.

我不玩游戏 我只发牌<br>
I don't play. I only deal.

谁说让你玩了<br>
Who said anything about you playing?

你就是牲畜 是布景而已<br>
You're livestock, scenery.

我才是玩家<br>
I play.

其他人 只是来发泄一下性欲<br>
The others, they just come here to get their rocks off,

或是杀几个印第安人的<br>
shoot a couple indians.

但这个游戏还有更深的层次<br>
But there's a deeper level to this game.

你要带我进入那里<br>
You're gonna show me how to get there.

古文化中蕴含了太多的智慧<br>
A lot of wisdom in ancient cultures.

或许...<br>
And perhaps it's...

是时候挖进你的大脑更深层了<br>
Time to dig deeper into yours.

不 不要<br>
No. No. No.

早上好 爸爸 睡得好吗<br>
Morning, daddy. Did you sleep well?

爸爸 你在外面坐了一整晚吗<br>
Daddy, you've been out here all night?

我有个问题<br>
I had a question.

一个不该问的问题<br>
A question you're not supposed to ask.

那让我获知了一个答案<br>
Which gave me an answer

一个你不该知道的答案<br>
you're not supposed to know.

怎么了 爸爸<br>
What's wrong, daddy?

你想知道...<br>
Would you like to know...

那个问题吗<br>
the question?

-问...问题吗 -妈妈<br>
\- question? - Mama!

妈妈 快来帮忙<br>
Mama, help! Come quick!

别担心<br>
Don't worry.

别担心 我会照顾好你<br>
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

不<br>
No!

你该走了 快走<br>
You should go. Leave.

你还不明白吗<br>
Don't you see?

地狱已空 恶魔倾巢而出 来到了这里<br>
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.

出自莎士比亚《暴风雨》

你待在这别动 明白吗<br>
You stay right here. Understand?

我去找医生<br>
I'm gonna find the doctor.

-你回来了 -我说过我会回来的<br>
\- You came back. - I told you I would.

-怎么了 -你快跟我来<br>
\- What's wrong? - You have to come with me right away.

我父亲病得很重<br>
My father's very ill.

我觉得我们还是先留在原地吧<br>
I think we best stay put.

好吧 好吧<br>
All right. All right.

经过不眠不休的辛勤工作<br>
With considerable effort and lack of sleep,

我终于设法让赫克托<br>
I've managed to massage events to inspire Hector

提前一周来到了镇上<br>
to head to town a week early.

我还写好了等他抢劫酒吧后<br>
Oh, and I've also punched up the speech he gives

要说的一段台词<br>
after robbing the saloon.

相当可怕 你到时候就知道了<br>
It's chilling. You'll see.

我等不及想知道了<br>
I can barely contain myself.

那是治安官的马 你这个混蛋<br>
That's the Sheriff's horse, you son of a bitch.

还有他的枪<br>
His rifle, too.

这儿有那么多银行和火车<br>
All the banks and trains around here,

你们这群恶棍偏偏要来抢我们<br>
and you fucking reprobates choose to rob us?

有何不可<br>
Why not?

你们都在这里放纵你们的罪恶<br>
You're all here indulging your particular vices.

所以我也来放纵我自己<br>
And so I've come to indulge mine.

我得回去找我父亲<br>
I've got to get back to father.

德洛丽丝 不<br>
Dolores, no!

泰迪<br>
Teddy.

别管我<br>
Don't mind me.

只是想...表现下骑士风度<br>
Just-- just trying to look chivalrous.

泰迪<br>
Oh, Teddy.

你真是个下作的混蛋<br>
You're a low-down son of a bitch.

我知道<br>
I know.

我知道我们有一个相同的理念<br>
I know we both believe the same thing.

不管活多脏<br>
No matter how dirty the business,

都要做好<br>
do it well.

那个保险箱里应该没什么值钱的<br>
No telling there's anything worthwhile in that safe.

我们应该带走这个小贱人<br>
We should take this sweet little bitch

以防万一<br>
just in case.

这就是正义的窘境 他们什么都打不中<br>
Problem with the righteous-- they can't shoot for shit.

不过倒是特别吵<br>
Making a hell of a racket, though.

通缉<br>
赫克托·艾斯卡顿<br>
杀人犯

你们想抓我<br>
You wanted me.

那就给你们上一课吧<br>
Well, let this be a lesson.

那就是<br>
The lesson is--

天<br>
Oh, jesus.

看 我刚打穿了他的脖子<br>
Look at that! I just shot him through the neck!

还有他的同伙<br>
And his pal here, too.

看她抽搐的样子<br>
Look at her wriggle.

叫那个摄影师过来<br>
Yo, go get that photographer.

我要拍张照<br>
I want to get a picture of this.

不客气<br>
You're welcome.

你写的那段台词还是下次再用吧<br>
Maybe you'll get to your speech next time.

泰迪<br>
Oh, Teddy.

至少我最后又见了你一面<br>
At least I got to see you one last time.

你不准死 听到了吗<br>
You're not going anywhere, now, hear?

每个人都有自己的路<br>
There's a path for everyone.

我的路是跟你相连的<br>
My path is bound with yours.

泰迪<br>
Teddy?

泰迪 不<br>
Teddy, no.

求你了<br>
Please.

不 我们才刚开始<br>
No, we've only just begun.

拍得不错 等等 等等<br>
That was good. Hang on. Hang on.

我戴上帽子拍 等我拿帽子<br>
Let me get the hat. Get the hat.

好了<br>
All right.

帮帮我<br>
Help, please.

我父亲在家里生病了<br>
My father's sick at home,

但我不能就这么把他丢在大街上<br>
but I can't just leave him out here in the street.

这很快就会变得像是一场遥远的梦境<br>
Soon this will all feel like a distant dream.

在此之前 愿你陷入一夜无梦的沉睡<br>
Until then, may you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber.

这里还有两个<br>
Two more over here.

全部找到了<br>
We got them all.

全部回收完毕<br>
That's all of them.

有初步结果了吗<br>
Any preliminary results?

大部分检查过都没问题<br>
Most of them are checking out fine.

其中有一个<br>
We had one who...

肯定出了问题<br>
definitely was not.

把她唤醒<br>
Bring her back online.

留下认知能力 去除情感影响<br>
Cognition only. No emotional affect.

亲爱的 听得到我说话吗<br>
All right, sweetheart, can you hear me?

是的<br>
Yes.

抱歉 我感觉不太好<br>
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.

去掉口音<br>
Lose the accent.

-你知道你身在何处吗 -我在梦里<br>
\- Do you know where you are? - I'm in a dream.

没错 德洛丽丝 你在梦里<br>
That's right, Dolores. You're in a dream.

一个也许能决定你人生的梦<br>
A dream that could determine your life.

你想从梦里醒来吗 德洛丽丝<br>
You want to wake up from this dream, Dolores?

是的<br>
Yes.

我很害怕<br>
I'm terrified.

没什么可怕的<br>
There's nothing to be afraid of,

只要你答对我的问题就可以了<br>
as long as you answer my questions correctly.

-明白了吗  -是的<br>
\- You understand? - Yes.

很好<br>
Good.

第一个问题<br>
First,

你是否质疑过你眼中现实世界的本质<br>
have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?

没有<br>
No.

你身边的人有过质疑吗<br>
Has anyone around you?

比如说你父亲<br>
For instance, your father?

他很害怕<br>
He was scared.

他的思维不清晰<br>
He wasn't thinking right.

他给你看了一张照片<br>
He showed you a picture.

是的<br>
That's right.

这张照片有什么古怪的地方吗<br>
Was there anything odd about that picture?

完全没有<br>
No, nothing at all.

我看不出来什么<br>
It didn't look like anything to me.

如果它违反规定 就要将其撤下<br>
If it breached, he needs to be put down.

政策就是如此<br>
That's the policy.

对我们来说 先找出原因不是最好的吗<br>
Would it not be best for us to discover why first,

卡伦女士<br>
Ms. Cullen?

请吧<br>
Please.

我们运行了全面诊断<br>
We've run a full diagnostic,

但是结果<br>
but the results are,

令人费解<br>
well, confusing.

告诉我 你的程序出了什么问题<br>
Tell me, what happened to your program?

出自莎士比亚《李尔王》 梁实秋译本

我们一生出来<br>
"When we are born,

我们便哭<br>
we cry we are come

因为我们来到了这个<br>
to this great stage

群丑的台上<br>
of f-f-fools."

可以了<br>
That is enough.

告诉我 你能接入先前的配置吗<br>
Tell me, do you have access to your previous configuration?

是的<br>
Yes.

请接入吧<br>
Access that, please.

你叫什么名字<br>

Mr. Peter Abernathy.

艾伯纳西先生 你的目标是什么<br>
Mr. Abernathy, what are your drives?

照料我的牲口<br>
Tend to my herd.

照顾我的妻子<br>
Look after my wife.

你的最终目标是什么<br>
Your final drive?

当然是我女儿德洛丽丝<br>
Well, my daughter Dolores, of course.

我必须保护德洛丽丝<br>
I must protect Dolores.

是她造就了我<br>
I am who I am because of her,

我<br>
and, well, I--

我不想成为...<br>
I wouldn't have it--

我不想成为别的...<br>
I-I wouldn't have it any...

别的样子<br>
other--

我必须警告她<br>
I-I have to warn her.

警告谁<br>
Warn who?

德洛丽丝<br>
Dolores.

他们对她做的事<br>

他们对她做的事<br>
The things you do to her.

我必须保护她<br>
I have to protect her.

必须帮她 我<br>
I have to help her. I--

她必须逃出去<br>
She's got to get out.

非常好 艾伯纳西先生<br>
Very good, Mr. Abernathy.

可以了<br>
That's enough.

这种行为<br>
This behavior,

已经远远超出了小故障的范畴<br>
we're miles beyond a glitch here.

你叫什么名字<br>

去见我的制造者<br>
To meet my maker.

你走运了<br>
Well, you're in luck.

你想对制造者说些什么<br>
And what do you want to say to your maker?

以肮脏龌龊的匠人之手<br>
By most mechanical and dirty hand...

出自莎士比亚《亨利四世》 梁实秋译本

出自莎士比亚《李尔王》 梁实秋译本

我必对你们痛加报复<br>
I shall have such revenges on you both.

我必定这样做<br>
The things I will do.

究竟做什么我现在还不知道<br>
What they are, yet I know not,

不过总是人间可怕的事<br>
but they will be the terrors of the earth.

你不知道自己在哪里吧<br>
You don't know where you are, do you?

这是你自掘的坟墓<br>
You're in a prison of your own sins.

关掉它<br>
Turn it off.

那是什么<br>
What the hell was that?

我不知道 他脱离剧本了<br>
I don't know. He's off script.

我们没有编写这些行为<br>
We didn't program any of those behaviors.

莎士比亚<br>

我们不是让这个接待员扮演过很多不同角色吗<br>
We've used this host in a number of different roles, have we not?

自从我来了这里 十年来他一直是艾伯纳西<br>
Since I've been here, he's been Abernathy for 10 years.

在那之前他做了一阵治安官<br>
He was sheriff for a while before then.

-再之前是 -教授<br>

出自于恐怖故事线《晚宴》<br>

他喜欢引用莎士比亚 <br>
He liked to quote Shakespeare,

约翰·邓恩 和格特鲁德·斯泰因<br>
John Donne, Gertrude Stein.

前两者16-17世纪 后者19-20世纪

我承认最后一个年代不太对<br>
I admit the last one is a bit of an anachronism,

但我难以抗拒<br>
but I couldn't resist.

这些是之前版本的记忆碎片<br>
These are fragments of prior builds.

冥思肯定让他接触了这些记忆碎片<br>
The reveries must be allowing him to access them.

没必要紧张 伯纳德<br>
No cause for alarm, Bernard.

只是我们过去的作品有些阴魂不散<br>
Simply our old work coming back to haunt us.

你父亲悄悄跟你说了一些话<br>
Your father whispered something to you.

是什么<br>

Promise.

他说<br>

没有<br>
No.

我觉得没有<br>
I don't think so.

你对我们撒过谎吗<br>
Have you ever lied to us?

没有<br>
No.

最后一个问题 德洛丽丝<br>
Last question, Dolores.

你会伤害任何生灵吗<br>
Would you ever hurt a living thing?

不会<br>
No.

当然不会<br>
