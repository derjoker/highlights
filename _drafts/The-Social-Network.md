你知道中国的天才人数<br>
Did you know there are more people with genius IQ living in China

比美国所有人都要多吗<br>
than there are people of any kind living in the United States?

这不可能<br>
That can't possibly be true.

是真的<br>
It is true.

这怎么可能呢<br>
What would **account** for that?

首先  中国人口多<br>
Well first of all, a lot of people live in China.

但我的问题是<br>
But here's my question:

你如何能让自己在一群SAT[美国高考]<br>
How do you distinguish yourself

考试中都拿1600分的人中突显出来呢<br>
in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's?

在中国他们不用参加SAT考试<br>
I didn't know they take SAT in China.

他们不用  我说的不是中国  我说我自己<br>
They dont,I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about me.

你考了一千六百分吗<br>
You got 1600?

没错  我在合唱团可以清唱但我自己不会唱<br>
Yes. I can sing in a Acapella group. But I cant sing.

那不是说你考试一题都没错吗<br>
Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong?

是说可以参加赛艇队或发明二十五美元电脑了<br>
Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar PC.

或者加入终极俱乐部<br>
Or you get into a final club.

没错  也可以加入终极俱乐部<br>
Or you get into a final club, exactly.

你知道从一个女人的角度看<br>
You know from a woman's perspective

不参加美声合唱团说不定是件好事<br>
sometimes not being in an Accapella group can be a good thing.

我是认真的<br>
This is serious.

我承认我喜欢赛艇队的男生<br>
Well I am admitting I do like guys who row crew.

可惜我不会划船<br>
Well I cant do that.

我开玩笑的<br>
I was kidding.

是的  我考试一题没错<br>
Yes. I got nothing wrong on the test.

你试过划船吗<br>
Have you ever tried?

正尝试着<br>
I'm trying now.

加入赛艇队吗<br>
To row crew?

加入终极俱乐部  你说参加赛艇队啊<br>
To get into a final club. To row crew?

我不会  你是不是有点妄想症啊<br>
No. Are you, like-whatever-delusional?

可能有时候吧<br>
Maybe just sometimes.

有时候你同时谈论两件事情<br>
Sometimes, you say two things at once

我都不知道你什么时候就切换话题了<br>
and I'm not sure which one we're aiming at.

你见过赛艇队的那些人  是吧<br>
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

没见过<br>
No.

好吧  他们比我高大<br>
Okay, well, they are bigger than me.

他们都是世界级的运动员  <br>
They're the world class athletes.

你刚才还说你喜欢赛艇队的男生来着<br>
And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew

所以我认为你是见过他们的<br>
so I assumed you'd met one.

我想我说的是加入赛艇队那主意不错<br>
I guess I meant I liked the idea of it.

就像女孩子都喜欢牛仔一样<br>
The way a girl likes cowboys.

好吧<br>
Okay.

我们要不要点东西来吃啊<br>
Should we get something to eat?

你是不是更想谈论点儿别的事情呢<br>
Would you rather talk about something else?

没有  只是从讨论这些终极俱乐部开始<br>
No, it's just that since the beginning of the

我觉得都快过完一个生日了<br>
conversation about finals clubs I think I may have missed a birthday.

中国天才的人数真的多过美国总人口吗<br>
There are more people in China with genius iQ than the entire population of...?

凤凰俱乐部是最复杂的<br>
The Phoenix is the most diverse.

还有飞翔俱乐部  罗斯福加入了烤瓷俱乐部<br>
The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc.

哪个罗斯福<br>
Which one?

烤瓷俱乐部  简称烤瓷  是最顶尖的<br>
The Porcelain, the Porc, it's the best of the best.

我其实问的是哪个罗斯福<br>
Which Roosevelt.

Theodore<br>
Theodore.

是不是真的他们得派公共汽车<br>
Is it true they send a bus around

去接要和下任主席一起参加派对的女孩<br>
to pick up girls who want to party with the next chairman?

你可以看得出加入这个俱乐部的重要性了吧<br>
You can see why it's so important to get in.

好吧  哪个是最容易加入的<br>
Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into?

你为什么问我这个<br>
Why would you ask me that?

就随便问问<br>
I was just asking.

没有容易进的  这才是关键<br>
None of them. That's the point.

我朋友Eduardo去年夏天靠赌<br>
Our freind Eduardo made $300,000

石油前景挣了三十万美元<br>
betting on oil future last summer and

就这样Eduardo想进还差得远呢<br>
Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

这里的人根本不把挣钱能力放在眼里<br>
The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.

一定很厉害<br>
Must be nice.

他一夏天挣了三十万美元啊<br>
He made $300,000 in a summer?

他喜欢气象学<br>
He likes Meteorology.

我以为他赌的是石油前景<br>
I thought it was oil futures.

你能读懂天气<br>
You can read the weather,

你就能预测民用燃料油的价钱<br>
you can predict the price of heating oil.

你刚那么问我是不是觉得只有<br>
I think you asked me that because you think the final

最容易进的终极俱乐部我才最有希望啊<br>
club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance.

我...什么<br>
I...what?

你问我哪个是最容易进的俱乐部<br>
You asked me which one was the easiest to

因为你觉得在那里我才最有机会<br>
get into because you think that's where I have the best chance.

门槛最低的俱乐部谁都容易进<br>
The one that's easiest to get into would be the one where anybody had the best chance.

你问的不是哪个是最好的<br>
You didnt ask which one was the best one,

你问我哪个是最容易进的<br>
you asked me which one was the easiest.

我就只是问问  行吗  我就问问<br>
I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was asking just to ask.

我没有影射其他  Mark<br>
Mark, I'm not speaking in code.

Erica<br>
Erica

你已经对终极俱乐部过于极端了<br>
You're obsessed with the finals clubs.

你得了终极俱乐部强迫症  你需要看看医生<br>
You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about this

让他开点儿药来治治 <br>
who'll prescribe some sort of medication.

你不在乎副作用是不是会让你瞎眼<br>
You don't care if side effects may include blindness,

是'final clubs'<br>
Final clubs,

不是'finals clubs'<br>
not finals clubs.

而且极端和积极是不一样<br>
And there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.

没错  是不一样<br>
Yes. There is.

你瞧  你刚就是含糊其辞  就是话有所指<br>
Well, what you do, that was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

我没有含糊其辞<br>
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

我所要说的就是我需要做些有意义的事<br>
All I'm saying I need to do something

来让那些俱乐部注意到我<br>
substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.

为什么<br>
Why?

因为他们独特<br>
Because they are exclusive.

有乐趣并能让我过的更好<br>
And fun and they lead me to a better life.

你认为Teddy Roosevelt当选<br>
You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected

总统就是因为他曾是凤凰俱乐部一员吗<br>
president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club?

他是烤瓷俱乐部的  并且我就是这样认为的<br>
He was a member of the Porcellian and yes he did.

你何不集中精力做你所能做的最好的自己  <br>
Well why dont you concentrate on being the best you, you can be.

你是认真那样说的吗<br>
Did you really just say that

开玩笑的<br>
I was kidding

我只是陈述事实并且我说的一点儿也不过分啊<br>
I'm just stating the fact and that doesn't make it any less true.

我就直说吧<br>
I want to be straight forward and tell you that

我觉得你该多支持我<br>
I think you should be a lot more supportive.

如果我入会了我可以带你去参加各种集会<br>
If I get in i'll be taking you to the events and the gatherings

你会有幸见到平常你很难见到的大人物<br>
and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet .

你真会带我去吗<br>
You would do that for me?

真的<br>
Indeed.

好  我就跟你直说了  我告诉你<br>
Okay I want to try and be straight forward with you

我们不再是一对儿了<br>
and let you know that were not anymore.

你什么意思<br>
What do you mean?

我们不再约会了  对不起<br>
We were not dating anymore, I'm sorry.

这是个玩笑话吗<br>
Is this a joke?

不  是真的<br>
No, it's not.

你要跟我分手吗<br>
You're breaking up with me?

你要介绍我认识一些我平常见不到的大人物<br>
You're going to introduce me to people I wouldn't normally get to meet?

这说的是什么混账话啊<br>
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

冷静下来<br>
Settle down.

你那是什么意思啊<br>
What was it supposed to mean?

Erica  我们之所以能坐在这里是<br>
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is

因为你过去和看门那家伙上过床<br>
that you used to sleep with the door guy.

看门那人有名字  叫Bobby  <br>
The door guy, his name is Bobby.

我没跟他上过床  他是我的一个朋友<br>
I haven't slept with the door guy, the door guy's a friend of mine.

他是个优秀的一等公民<br>
He's a perfectly good class of people

你又是从长岛哪里冒出来的啊<br>
and what part of Long-Island are you from?

Wimbledon吗<br>
Wimbledon?

等等<br>
Wait.

我要回宿舍了<br>
I'm going back to my dorm.

等等<br>
Wait wait.

这是真的吗<br>
Is this real?

是的<br>
Yes.

那等等  我道歉  好不好<br>
Then wait, I apologize, okay?

我必须走了...<br>
I have to go...

Erica<br>
Erica

怎么啦<br>
Yes?

对不起  我真心的<br>
I'm sorry and I mean it..

我很感激但我要去学习了<br>
I appreciate that but I have to study

别这样  你不是要回去学习的  <br>
Come on. You don't have to study.

你不必回去的  我们谈谈好吗<br>
You don't have to study. Let's just talk.

我不能<br>
I can't.

为什么不<br>
Why?

因为我精疲力竭了<br>
Because it's exhausting.

跟你约会就像根跑步机约会<br>
Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.

我所说的就是你不必要现在...<br>
All I meant is that you're not likely to...currently

我不是在评断你父母  <br>
I wasn't making an coment on your parents.

我只是说你要去波士顿大学  <br>
I was saying you go to B.U.

我就是陈述事实  就这样  <br>
I was stating a fact. That's all.

如果你认为我太粗鲁<br>
If you think I'm rude...

我要去看书了<br>
I have to go study.

你不必去的<br>
You don't have to study.

你为什么总说我不用学习啊<br>
Why do you keep saying I dont have to study?

因为你就念个波士顿大学啊<br>
Because you go to B.U.!

想吃点什么吗<br>
Do you want to get some food?

非常抱歉我的大学没能让你满意<br>
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.

我也抱歉我没有赛艇<br>
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat.

所以我们扯平了<br>
So were even.

我觉得我们只做朋友就好<br>
I think we should just be friends.

我不需要朋友<br>
I don't want friends.

我那是客气  我一点儿也不想跟你做朋友<br>
I was being polite, I had no intention of being friends with you.

我现在因为操作系统课业倍感压力<br>
I'm under some pressure right now from my O.S. class.

我们要点东西吃  我想我们能...<br>
If we could just order some food, I think we should...

听着  你也许能在IT界大有作为<br>
Listen, you're probably going to be a very succesful computer person.

但生活中你却一直苦恼女孩子不喜欢你<br>
But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't

是因为你是个书呆子<br>
like you because you're a nerd.

我想告诉你的是  我打心底不这样认为<br>
And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that won't be true.

那是因为你是个混蛋<br>
It'll be because you're an asshole.

饥渴学子酒吧

哈佛大学  秋季  二零零三年

柯克兰公寓

晚上  八点十三分

Erica Albright是个婊子<br>
Erica Albright is a bitch.

你觉得是因为她家人从Albrecht改姓<br>
Do you think that's because her family changed

还是你觉得所有波士顿大学的女生都是婊子呢<br>
their name from Albrecht or do you think it's because all B.U. Girls are bitches?

特此声明  她也许看着有三十四C<br>
For the record, she may look like a 34C

但那全是丰胸内衣的作用<br>
but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret.

她只有三十四B  里面几乎空空如也<br>
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.

全是虚张声势<br>
False advertising.

晚上  九点四十八分

实情是她脸蛋儿还不错<br>
The truth is she has a nice face.

我需要做点什么才能转移我的注意力<br>
I need to do something to take my mind off her.

说着简单  可就是我还没个好主意<br>
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

我有点喝醉了  我是不会撒谎的<br>
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.

这虽不是周末之夜又有什么关系呢<br>
So what if it's not even 10PM and it's a Tuesday night?

我这栋公寓的Facebook开在我桌面上<br>
The Kirkland facehook is open on my desktop

有的人放着可怕的Facebook照片<br>
and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.

比利·奥尔森坐在这里  他出了个主意<br>
Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of

说把这些照片和家禽放在一起<br>
the pictures next to pictures of farm animals

然后让大家投票看谁更火辣<br>
and have people vote on who's hotter.

这主意不错啊  Olson先生<br>
Good call, Mr.Olson

我们开始吧<br>
Yeah, it's on.

我不准备放家禽照<br>
I'm not gonna do the farm animals

但我觉得比较两个人这主意不错<br>
but I like the idea of comparing two people together.

它让整件事有种"图灵机"的感觉<br>
It gives the whole thing a very

[一种可不受储存容量限制的假想计算机]<br>
"Turing"

因为这比用数字代表热辣程度的网站更含蓄<br>
feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot.com.

首先我们需要许多照片<br>
The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures.

不幸的是哈佛没有公共公开的Facebook<br>
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook

所以我将从各自宿舍的电脑盗取他们照片<br>
so I'm going to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in.

黑客要出场了<br>
Let the hacking begin.

首先从Kirkland开始<br>
First up is Kirkland.

这里的一切都是公开的<br>
They keep everything open

并允许在Apache里插入索引<br>
and allow indexes in their Apache configuration,

所以用WGET就足以下载整个<br>
so a little WGET magic

Kirkland的Facebook图片了<br>
is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook.

小孩游戏<br>
Kids stuff.

接下来是Elliot公寓<br>
Next is Elliot.

他们也是公开的但在Apache上没有索引<br>
They're also open but with no indexes on Apache.

我能进行一个空白搜索<br>
I can run an empty search

接着数据库里的所有图片就会呈单页显示出来<br>
and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page.

然后我保存网页  摩斯拉[浏览器名]<br>
Then I can save the page and Mozilla

会帮我保存照片<br>
will save all the images for me.

好极了<br>
Excellent.

进展不错<br>
Moving right along.

大家注意一下<br>
Excuse me, everybody.

你们现在所在的是全世界不只是哈佛<br>
You are in one of the oldest,

最古老最有特色俱乐部之一<br>
one of the most exclusive clubs, not just in Havard, in the world.

现在我宣布凤凰俱乐部秋学期第一次舞会开始<br>
Now I would welcome you to Phoenix first party of the falls emester

Lowell楼有安全防护<br>
Lowell has some security.

需要要用户名和密码组合<br>
They require a username/password combo,

我会直接进入并声称他们没有FAS用户权限<br>
and I'm going to go ahead and say they don't have access to main FAS user database,

所以他们没办法察觉到这次侵入<br>
so they have no way of detecting an intrusion

Adams楼没有安全网<br>
Adams has no security

但每页设限只显示二十个结果<br>
but limits the number of results to 20 a page.

我只需用在罗威尔使用过的相同程式即可破解<br>
All I have to is break up the same script I used on Lowell and it's set.

Quincy楼没有在线Facebook<br>
Quincy has no online Facebook,

太可惜了<br>
what a sham.

对此我也无能为力<br>
Nothing I can do about that.

Dunster楼很难搞<br>
Dunster is intense.

那里不仅没有公共目录  是任何目录都没有<br>
Not only is there no public directory but there's no directory at all.

你必须进行搜索<br>
You have to do searches and

每个搜索超过二十个结果则什么都不会显示<br>
every search returns more than 20 matches nothing is returned.

一旦有个结果  它们不会直接连接到图片<br>
Once you do get results they don't link directly to the images,

而是连接到个人网页或别的什么  很奇怪<br>
they link to a PHP that redirects or something. Weird.

这估计比较难搞定  我回头再弄<br>
This maybe diffucult, I'll come back later.

-Sheldon醒了 -你说什么<br>
\- Hey, Sheldon's up. - What?

-厉害的酒  漂亮的鱼  -谢谢分享<br>
\- Great wine, beautiful fish. - Thanks.

Leverett楼稍微好点<br>
Leverett is a little better.

当然你还得进行搜索  但是<br>
It's still make you search but you

空白搜索会链接到有每个学生照片的网页上<br>
can do an empty search and gets links to pages with every student's picture.

但每次只能浏览一张这有点讨厌 <br>
It's slightly obnoxious that they let you view one picture at a time.

我是不可能去浏览五百个网页<br>
And there's no way I am gonna go to 500 hundred pages,

来下载一百次照片的<br>
to download pictures one hundred times.

因此退出EMACS编辑<br>
So its definitely necessary to break out the EMACS

来修改Perl代码就非常必要了<br>
and modify that Perl script.

凌晨  两点零八分

搞定了<br>
Done.

怎么啦<br>
What's going on?

时间正好  Eduardo来了<br>
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here

他有我最需要的东西<br>
and he's going to have the key ingredient.

-Mark  -怎么啦<br>
\- Mark -What up?

你和Erica分手啦<br>
You and Erica split up?

你怎么知道的<br>
How did you know that?

你博客上都写着呢<br>
It's on your blog.

哦  是啊<br>
Oh yeah.

你还好吧<br>
Are you alright?

我需要你帮忙<br>
I need you.

我就是为你而来<br>
I'm here for you.

不是这个  我需要你赌石油预期时的公式<br>
No, I need the algorithm you used for the oil futures.

你没事儿吧<br>
Are you okay?

我们在给女孩子们排名<br>
We're ranking girls.

你说其他女学生吗<br>
You mean other students.

是的<br>
Yeah.

你觉得这是个好主意吗<br>
You think that's such a good idea?

我需要那个运算公式<br>
I need the algorithm.

我需要那个运算公式<br>
I need the algorithm.

给每个女孩一千四百的基础分数<br>
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

在某一时刻女孩A得到R-a的评分<br>
At any time "Girl A" has a rating R-a

女孩B得到R-b的评分<br>
and "Girl B" has e rating R-b.

当对任意两个女孩进行评比时<br>
When any two girls are matched up there's

会有个根据现有评分进行的预测<br>
an expectation of which will win based on their current rating.

没错<br>
Yeah.

这些预测写出来就是这样的<br>
And Those expectations are expressed this way.

我们写程序吧<br>
Let's write it.

左边那个<br>
The one on the left.

右边的<br>
On the right.

右边<br>
The right.

这个可以用了<br>
It works.

我们该先传给谁呢<br>
Who should we send it to first?

- Dwyer  - Neal<br>
\- Dwyer. - Neal.

你打算先传给谁呢<br>
Who are you gonna send it to?

就那么几个人  问题是  他们会传给谁呢<br>
Just a Couple of people. The question is, who are they gonna send it to?

大伙儿过来看看<br>
Hey guys, check this out.

左边那个<br>
The one on the left.

这些女孩  选右边还是左边<br>
These girls, right or Left?

左边<br>
Left.

右边还是左边<br>
Right or Left?

那是我室友<br>
That's my roommate.

天哪  左边的<br>
Oh my God. On the left.

真可悲<br>
This is pathetic.

右边<br>
Right.

左边<br>

左边<br>

见鬼<br>
Shit!

Albright他在博客中说你了<br>
Albright, he blogged about you.

你不会想看到的<br>
You don't want to read this.

Erica  这是你的胸衣吗<br>
Erica, is this yours?

我们从新生那里偷来的<br>
I stole it from a trainee.

给我滚出去<br>
Get the hell out of here.

这流量真TM的大啊<br>
Thats an awful lot of traffic.

你说我们是不是在它惹麻烦前把它关了啊<br>
You think maybe we should shut it down before we get into trouble.

喂<br>
Hello?

慢着  慢点说...<br>
Wait wait wait...

在凌晨四点钟吗<br>
At 4 in the morning?

那里有个流量异常网站<br>
Well there is an unusual amount of traffic which occured.

你说不正常是说凌晨四点不该有那个流量吗<br>
Your saying its unusal for 4 in the morning?

不  就算是在超级碗比赛中场<br>
No, this would be unusuall

这个流量也不正常<br>
for half time at the superbowl.

好吧<br>
Alright.

我得去工作<br>
I gotta go in.

出什么事了<br>
What's going on?

哈佛的网络要崩溃了<br>
The Harvard network is about to crash.

你说不会是...<br>
You dont think...

是的<br>
I do.

上帝保佑我们每个人吧<br>
God saves us everybody.

连接不上<br>
Can't connect.

网络瘫痪了<br>
The network is down.

如果不是巧合  我觉得是我们造成的<br>
Unless this is a coincidence I would think this is us.

这不是巧合<br>
It's not a coincidence.

哦  见鬼<br>
Oh shit.

所以说你被校委会传唤了<br>
So you're called in front of the ad. board.

不是那样的<br>
That's not what happened.

你没被校委会传唤吗<br>
You weren't called in front of the administartive board.

不  先倒回去  回到和<br>
No, back, let's back at the bar

Erica Albright在酒吧那晚<br>
with Erica Albright.

她那么说吗  我跟她说了那样的话吗<br>
She said all that? That I said that stuff to her.

我是看着她的证词记录说的<br>
I was reading from the transcript of her deposition.

你们究竟为什么要她作证啊<br>

我收到凤凰俱乐部的邀请了<br>
I got punched by the Phoenix.

只是正式加入前的第一步<br>
It's just the first step before the process.

-人们会访问Facemash  -对<br>
\- People came to "Facemash" to step in, right? - Yeah.

并不是那些美女的照片吸引了他们<br>
It wasn't because they saw pictures of hot girls,

因为在网上<br>
you can go anywhere on the internet

-美女的照片无处不在  -对<br>
\- and see pictures of hot girls.  - Yeah.

而是因为他们能看到熟悉女生的照片<br>
Because they saw pictures of girls that they knew.

大家想上网访问他们的朋友<br>
People want to go on the internet and check out their friends

何不建一个这样的网站  提供朋友  照片  档案等信息<br>
so why not build a web site that offers them freinds, pictures, profiles

你可以随意浏览<br>
whatever you can visit browse around,

甚至能访问你在派对刚认识的女孩<br>
maybe someone you just met at a party.

我说的不是什么交友网站<br>

我指的是  将整个大学的社交网络<br>

搬到网上去<br>

Can't feel my legs.

I know.

-这太令人兴奋了  Eduardo  -好啊<br>
\- I'm totally psyched about this, Eduardo. - Yeah.

You would have to know the people on the site

才能同意他访问你的页面  就像...<br>
to get past your own page, like...

收到邀请<br>
getting punched.

It was a great idea.

people were gonna provide their own pictures, their own information.

还可以选择<br>
And people would have the ability

是否邀请自己的好友加入这个网络<br>
to invite or not invite their friends to join.

想象一个完全由社群组织构建的世界<br>
In a world where social structure was everything?

它就是那样一个世界<br>
That was the thing.

这是项浩大的工程<br>
It was a big project,

他要编写成千上万行代码<br>
and he was going to have to write tens of thousands lines of code.

我那时就想  为什么是他  而不是他室友来找我<br>
So I was wondering why he was coming to me and not his roommates.

Dustin Moscovitz  Chris Hughes  他们都是程序员<br>
Dustin Moscovitz, Chris Hughes, they were programmers.

需要一点启动资金<br>
We're gonna need a little start up cash

租一个服务器好让它上线<br>
to rent a server to get it online.

那就是原因<br>
So that was why.

-他提条件了吗  -当然<br>
\- Did he offer terms. - Yes.

咱们三七分成<br>
We'll split it 70/30.

你提供一千美元资金<br>
70 for me 30 for you for putting up the

负责商务运作  你三我七吧<br>
1000 dollars and for handling everything on the business end.

你就是首席财务官<br>
You're CFO.

你回答...<br>
And you said...

我回答  就这么干了<br>
I said, "Let's do it".

那么  他还说什么了吗<br>
OK, did he add anything else?

说了<br>
Yes.

它也许没那么复杂<br>
It probably wasn't a diversity thing.

那又怎样<br>
So what.

你觉得他为什么要说那句话<br>
Why you think he said that?

Gretchen  抱歉打断一下  我们到底在问谁<br>
Gretchen, excuse me for interupting, whose discovery is this.

Sy  请让我先问完<br>
Sy, if you let me continue with my line of questioning.

他们想说  Eduardo收到凤凰俱乐部的邀请令我妒火中烧<br>
They are suggesting that I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched

于是我计划将他从未来公司的团队中踢出去<br>
by the Phoenix and began a plan to screw him out of a company that I hadn't even invent yet.

是吗<br>
Were you?

Gretchen<br>
Gretchen!

嫉妒Eduardo<br>
Jealous of Eduardo?

别记录了...<br>
Stop typing we're all...

我想你们一定做足了功课<br>
I know you've done your homework

知道我并不在乎钱<br>
and know money is not a big part of my life.

但现在我可以买下整条Auburn street<br>
But at the moment I could buy all Auburn street,

把凤凰俱乐部改成我的乒乓球室<br>
take the Phoenix club and turn it into my ping-pong room.

我会告诉你派对的情况<br>
I'll let you know how the party is.

你是这起Facebook案子诉讼的原告<br>
We recognise that you're a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook

和另一起诉讼的证人<br>
and a witness in another.

是的  先生<br>
Yes, sir.

在Mark与你分享这个创意的前几周里<br>
At any time in the weeks prior to Mark telling you his idea,

他提到过Tyler Winklevoss  Cameron Winklevoss<br>
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss,

Dedre Revedra或哈佛网络吗<br>
Dedre Revedra or Harvard Connection?

说过<br>
Yes,

他说他们请他去建网站<br>
he said they asked him to work on their site.

但他看过他们的成果后<br>
But that he looked at what they had

觉得那就是浪费他的时间<br>
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

他说  就算他最菜的朋友<br>
He said even his most pathetic friends

也比这群家伙强<br>
knew about getting people interested

更能让网站吸引大众眼球<br>
in the website than these guys.

这群家伙是指我的当事人吗<br>
These guys means my clients?

是<br>
Yes.

他很不爽  Mark很不爽他们...<br>
He resented, Mark resented that they...

因为你的当事人说<br>
your clients thought

他需要在Facemash后恢复形象<br>
that he needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash.

Mark没想在Facemash后挽回什么<br>
Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything with Facemash.

他黑进了哈佛的电脑网络<br>
Hacked into the Harvard computers,

戏耍了行政委员会<br>
he blew his nose at the add-board.

名声四起<br>
He got a lot of notoriety.

他所期待的东西  都通过Facemash实现了<br>
Facemash did exactly what he wanted to do.

那你是否清楚在Zuckerberg先生建立The Facebook的过程中<br>
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was buliding the"The Facebook"

他还一直与原告保持着联系呢<br>
he was also communictaing with the plaintiffs?

当时不知道  但...<br>
Not at the time I wasn't, but...

它跟Winklevoss的交友网站没什么干系<br>
It really did not have much to do with the Winklevoss dating site.

你怎么知道  你根本就不在场<br>
How would you know, you weren't even there.

那你是否知道在Zuckerberg先生<br>
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg

建立The Facebook的过程中<br>
was building the "The Facebook",

他想让原告认为<br>
he was leading the plaintiffs

他在为建立哈佛网络工作<br>
to believe he was building the Harvard Connection.

貌似想向我推销Brooks Brothers西服<br>
it they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers suit.

上午好<br>
Good morning

上午好  先生<br>
Good morning, sir

我是Cameron Winklevoss  这是我弟弟Tyle<br>
I'm Cameron Winklevoss, this is my brother Tyle.

你们来这儿是为<br>
Are you here because?

抱歉先生  我以为您是在读信<br>
I'm sorry sir, I thought you were reading the letter.

读完了<br>
Read the letter.

是这样的  我们之前有了一个想法  <br>
Well, we came up with an idea 

建一个叫作哈佛互联的网站<br>
for a website called "Harvard Connection"

后来改为CONNECTU<br>
we've since changed the name to CONNECTU.

然而Mark Zuckerberg盗用了这个想法并且<br>
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and

明白<br>
I understand

那你想让我怎么做呢<br>
and I'm asking what you want me to do about it?

好的  先生<br>
Well, sir

在哈佛每年发给新生的学生手册中<br>
In the HARVARD student handbook which is distributed to each freshman

在哈佛学生社团管理标准一章中<br>
Under the heading standars of conduct in the HARVARD community

明确表明学校期望每为学生都能诚实守信<br>
it says the college expects all the students to be honest

并在随后与社团成员的交往中<br>
and forthcoming in their dealings with members in the community

须得尊重公众及私人财产<br>
stundents are required to respect public and private ownership

对于偷窃  不合情理的行为<br>
and instances of theft, missappropriation...

Anne<br>
Anne?

在<br>
Yes sir?

揍我一拳  你继续<br>
Punch me in the face, go ahead.

或者<br>
or

或者未经许可的使用会予以相应处分<br>
or unauthorised use will result in disciplinary action

包括开除学籍<br>
including required withdrawl from the college.

你背出那么一大段想说明什么<br>
You memorised that instead of doing what

我和弟弟来这儿是为了郑重地请求您<br>
What my brother came and I came here to ask you respectfully

先生  盗窃这种行为有悖于学校的规则制度<br>
Sir its against university rules to steal from other students

非常明显<br>
plain and simple

跟宿舍管理员反映过吗<br>
Have you spoken to your housemaster?

有的  先生<br>
Yes sir.

宿舍管理员建议我们向AD BOARD投诉可AD BOARD不予交涉<br>
And the housemaster made a recommendation to the AD BOARD but the AD BOARD wont hear us.

你们试过跟另一方直接交涉吗<br>
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly?

Zuckerburg先生在过去的两个礼拜里没有<br>
Mr. Zuckerburg hasn't been responding 

对我们的一封邮件与电话做过回应<br>
to any of our e-mails and phone calls for the last 2 weeks.

我们去科克兰拜访他的时候也不开门回应<br>
he doesnt answer when we knock on his door at KIRKLAND

我和Mark本人距离最近的面对面交涉<br>
and the closest I've come to dealing with him face to face

是在院子里碰巧看到他  然后追他<br>
when I saw him on the quad and chased him through HARVARD SQUARE.

追他<br>
chased him?

我  我看到了他而且他肯定也看到了我  <br>
I I I saw him and I know he saw me, 

所以才追的<br>
I went after him

然后他不见了<br>
and he disapeaared.

我不认为这个在学校管理范围内<br>
I don't see this as a universty issue.

当然在学校管理范围内了<br>
Of course it's a a universty issue.

这牵涉到道德法则<br>
There's a code of ethics

以及荣誉法则  而他两个都违犯了<br>
and an honor code and he violated them both.

你们与学校之间有道德契约<br>
you entered into a code of ethics with the university.

你们之间没有<br>
not with each other.

很抱歉  Summers校长<br>
I'm sorry President Summers.

我觉得你刚说的纯属无稽之谈<br>
What you just said makes no sense to me at all.

真令人伤心<br>
I'm devestated by that.

我弟弟的意思是<br>
What my brother means is

Mark Zuckerburg走进我们寝室然后偷走了我们的电脑<br>
Mark Zuckerburg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer.

那样就是校方要管的了<br>
That would be a universty issue.

不晓得  这间办公室不是用来处理小偷小摸的<br>
I don't know, this office doesn't handle petty larceny.

这不是小偷小摸<br>
This isnt petty larceny.

这个想法的潜在价值值上百万<br>
This idea is potentialy worth millions of dollars.

上百万<br>
Millions?

没错<br>
Yes.

你最好让你的想象力跟着你一块走好了<br>
You might just be letting your imaginations run away with you.

先生<br>
Sir

我觉得身居高位不应当下此断论<br>
I honestly don't think your in any position to make that call

我做过财政部长<br>
I was the US Treasury Secretary.

我有资格那样说<br>
I'm in some position to make that call.

让想象力伴随我们成长<br>
"Letting our imagnations run away with us "

那个不正是您在新生演讲词中所说的吗<br>
Is exactly what we were told to do in your Freshaman address?

没错  而现在我想建议你让你的想象力<br>
well then I would suggest that you let your imaginations

着力于新的创意上<br>
run away with you on a new project.

是吗<br>
You would?

哈佛的每个人都在创造<br>
everyone at HARVARD is inventing something

哈佛在校生相信<br>
HARVARD undergarduates believe that inventing

创造一项新的工作比找到工作更有意义<br>
a job is better then finding a job.

所以我再次建议<br>
So I suggest again that

你们两个把精力放在新的创意上<br>
the 2 of you come up with a new new project.

抱歉  先生  您可能跑题了<br>
I'm sorry, sir. But thats not the point

行吧<br>
Please

这个才是重点<br>
come right at the point.

您不必像一位高明的财经专家<br>
You don't have to be a intellectual property expert 

那样辨别对错之间的差别<br>
to understand the difference between right and wrong.

你说我没必要<br>
You're saying that I don't?

不是那个意思  先生<br>
Of course I am not saying that sir.

我就是那个意思<br>
I'm saying that.

是吗<br>
Really?

Ann<br>
Ann

这个见面会是怎么安排的<br>
How did I get this appointment?

他俩父亲的同事<br>
Colleagues of their father

我来告诉你们吧  Winklevoss先生与Winklevoss先生<br>
Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss.

你们一再提及关于对错的事情<br>
Since your on the subject of right and wrong

这件事  这次会议<br>
This action, this meeting

你们两个在这里  就是错的<br>
The 2 of you being here, is wrong

这是哈佛所不屑的<br>
It's not worthy of Harvard,

这不是哈佛想在你们身上看到的<br>
it's not what Harvard saw in you.

你们不应当搞特权<br>
You don't get special treatment.

我们并没有<br>
We never asked ...

等等  您说搞个新的创意<br>
Wai ...Wai..Start another project

像在科学会展上搞个立体模型<br>
Like were amking a diorama for a science fair

WinkleVoss先生  如果你还有什么问题<br>
If you have a problem with that Mr WinkleVoss

我们从未要求特殊对待<br>
We never asked for special treatment.

你们完全可以采取司法途径<br>
The courts allways at your disposal.

还有可以为您效劳的吗<br>
Is there anything else I can do for you.

谢了<br>
Ty.

感谢  叨扰了<br>
Thank you very much for your time.

不小心弄坏了有三百多年历史的门把手<br>
I broke a 335 year old door knob.

Eduardo  新年的时候你<br>
Eduardo, spring break you

同Zuckerburg先生去了趟纽约<br>
and Mr. Zuckerburg took a trip to New York.

是的<br>
Yes.

去那做什么<br>
What was the purpose of the trip?

呃  我以首席财务官的身份安排了同几个潜在客户的见面会<br>
Well, as CFO I set up some meetings with potential advertisers.

谁来承担旅行费用<br>
Who paid for the trip?

用这几个月来我自己攒下来的一千美元<br>
It was paid for out of the thousand dollar account I set up a few months earlier.

到那时为止  那一千美元<br>
At this point your thousand dollars 

是投在公司上的唯一资金吗<br>
was the only money that had been put into the company.

是的<br>
Yes.

会议进行得怎样<br>
How did you feel the meetings went?

糟糕透了<br>
Went terribly.

为何<br>
Why?

Mark老打瞌睡<br>
Mark was asleep.

我没打瞌睡<br>
I was not asleep.

可以修正下我的回答吗<br>
Can I repharse my answer?

我倒希望他睡着了<br>
I wish he was asleep.

现在已经覆盖到二十九所大学  注册人员超过七万五千<br>
So were at 29 schools now with over 75000 members.

去Facebook的人习惯性地喜欢多待一会<br>
People who go on the Facebook tend to stay on longer

比其它站点待得时间都要长  <br>
than almost any other web site. 

这样就有了如下惊人的数据<br>
Now heres the most impressive statistc.

百分之九十一的人第一次玩Facebook后<br>
91% of the people who try it once 

就会玩第二次  现在如果你允许我<br>
come back. Now if you'll allow me

打扰一下<br>
Excuse me one second

他在弄什么  滴答滴答的  <br>
What sound is he making, is that like a tick?

不是滴滴答<br>
Was'nt a tick

而是<br>
Was

喉咙里面<br>
Like throttle sound.

就像咽喉反射<br>
Almost a gag reflex

你们什么意思<br>
What is this ...

那次纽约之行还有一次会议<br>
There was 1 more meeting scheduled for the New York.

是的  是个饭局<br>
Yes, it was a dinner.

是我当时的女朋友安排的<br>
It was set up through my girlfriend at the time.

Mark对这个会议很兴奋吗<br>
Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting？

是的<br>
Yes.

非常兴奋<br>
Very.

他们不会把我们轰出去吧<br>

Don't be embarrassed。

跟他说他们不会轰我们的<br>

他们不会轰我们的<br>
Their not gonna card us.

Mark<br>
Mark

这次你又要谈广告吗<br>
Are you gonna talk about adds again.

除非你是哈佛芭蕾学院的<br>
Unless your the BALLET THEATRE of HARTFORD,

做生意不就是为了挣钱吗<br>
the purpose of business is to make a profit.

可现在还没成熟<br>
It isn't a business yet.

别这么说行不行啊  这是我的事情<br>
That's...that's tough for me , Its my job.

别担心<br>
Never mind

都过去二十五分钟了<br>
25 minutes late.

他可是纳普斯特的创始人  当时才19岁<br>
He started Napster, when he was 19.

他有资格迟到<br>
He can be late.

他又不是上帝<br>
He is not a God.

那是什么<br>
What is he?

他是迟到了二十五分钟的那人<br>
He's 25 minutes late.

你不会是嫉妒人家吧<br>
I think you're not jealous

老实说真没嫉妒<br>
I honestly wasn't jealous.

只是紧张<br>
I was nervous.

怎么说<br>
Why?

我从未见过他<br>
I didn't know him at all.

但之前做过调查并且四处打听<br>
But I had done a search and asked around and he

他给我的感觉是<br>
He struck me as a kind of an....

终结者<br>
Wildcard.

怎么说<br>
Why?

他把两家互联网公司搞得倒闭了<br>
He crashed out of 2 pretty big Internet companies

而公司当时发展态势正好  他还吸毒<br>
in spectacular fashion and hes got a reputation with drugs.

可也是他创建了那两家公司<br>
He also founded the companies.

没错  所以我们不需要他<br>
We don't need him.

来了<br>
He's here.

我是Sean Parker<br>
I'm Sean Parker.

你好<br>
How do you do.

这位一定是Eduardo<br>
You must be Eduardo.

Christy  Mark<br>
and Christy, and Mark.

很高兴见到你们<br>
Great to meet you.

什么都没点啊<br>
You guys don't have anything in front of you.

还没<br>

Tori<br>
Tori

嘿  宝贝儿<br>
Hee, baby boy.

可以给我们来点什么吗<br>
Could you bring out somethings.

糖醋扣肉  <br>
The laquered pork with that ginger confit

金枪鱼大排  再来点龙虾  这样我们就可以开始了<br>
Tuna tartar , and the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

Christy<br>

What do you like to drink?

那之后就是Sean的个人秀了<br>
From that point on it was a show of Sean.

问题是你们都谈了些什么<br>
The question was what did you talk about.

他详述关于纳普斯特的故事<br>
He took through his episode with NAPSTER.

我可不想二十几岁年纪轻轻就做个防卫者<br>
I didn't want to spend my 20's as a professinal defender.

谁曾想到二零零三年初<br>
Who knew that in the begining of 2003--

他们会试图卖掉公司来偿还三千五百万<br>
They tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million

据称是我们欠下的版税  <br>
they said we owed in royalties 

可我跟他们讲那样做就像<br>
but I guess to them that was a little like

卖掉一辆偷来的车来偿还偷来的汽油<br>
Selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

于是我们说  去他妈的<br>
So we said screw it

然后宣布破产<br>
and declared bankruptcy.

可是你却成名了<br>
You made a name for yourself.

你呢  没酒了<br>
And you are dry.

Tory<br>
Tory

然后他继续讲述第二次商业冒险<br>
And then he went on to his secound business venture

是一个在线通讯薄<br>
which was an online rolodex

字幕<br>
that he got thrown out of by his equity

这次我想干漂亮点  打上领带<br>
And I wanted to do it nicely, I put on a tie

擦亮皮鞋  可是没人愿意搭理一个毛头小子<br>
and shined my shoes, but nobody wanted to take orders from a kid.

所以让我告诉你们吧<br>
So let me tell you what

一个20岁的毛头小子<br>
what happened through a 20 year old 

为了让网站成功都做了什么<br>
to the top of that dot-com.

我不是精神科医生  但是...<br>
I'm not a psychiatrist,but...

这我们都知道<br>
We got that on the record.

你不是精神科医生  然后呢<br>
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

精神科医生肯定说他是妄想症<br>
A psychiatrist would say that he was paranoid.

那帮人找私家侦探日夜跟踪你<br>
They hired private detectives who followed you day and night.

你可是个高额悬赏金的目标人物<br>
You were target for high priced escorts.

我没有证据  但我知道他们窃听我电话<br>
I can't prove it but I know they tapped my phone,

无论用什么招数我都会察觉  我没救了  <br>
so whatever it is I'm gonna trip you up. You've done already.

个人行为是时光所留下来的遗迹<br>
Private behaviour is a relic of a time gone by,

某种程度上讲  我们跟<br>
and somehow,someway you've

达赖喇嘛的生活方式很像<br>
managed to live your life like the DALI LAMA

当然这都是废话<br>
though make shit up because

但他们要的不是你这个人  而是你的创意<br>
they don't want you, they want your idea,

而且他们还要在你说完"不好意思"  <br>
and they want you to say thank you while you

摸摸下巴走人之后<br>
"excuse me",

还要说上句谢谢<br>
wipe your chin and walk away.

这些都是你经历过的吗<br>
That's what happened to you?

他还各种臆想<br>
And delusional.

对<br>
Yes.

但他们肯定不会就此罢手  <br>
But there'll be payback in case. 

我已经用Napster<br>
I brought down 

击垮唱片公司了<br>
the record companies with Napster

他们也一定会...<br>
and cases of their suffer seems too...

不好意思  你并没击垮唱片公司<br>
Sorry, you didn't bring down the record companies,

他们赢了<br>
They won.

官司而已<br>
In court.

你想在Tower店里[唱片店铺连锁]<br>
You want to buy 

买唱片吗  Eduardo<br>
a Tower record, Eduardo?

接着他就一直讲他在硅谷的生活<br>
And he told story after story about

在斯坦福和洛杉矶的参加的晚会<br>
life in silicon valley, parties at Stanford,

还有他那些变成百万富翁的朋友<br>
down in LA, freinds who become millionaires,

但说的最多的还是劝Mark一定要去加州<br>
but mostly how Mark had to, he had to come to California...

最后他还是说到了Facebook<br>
and then he cut around to Facebook.

跟我说说进展情况<br>
So tell me about your progress.

我们已经进驻29个大学了<br>
Well, we're in 29 schools now,

已经有75000个会员<br>
we got over 75000 members.

讲讲你们的策略<br>
Tell me about the strategy you're using.

-好  -就像我们想进德克萨斯的贝勒大学<br>
\- Ok. - For intance we wanted Baylor in Texas,

但贝勒校内已经有网络了<br>
but Baylor already had a social network on campus so

我们没有被它牵制住<br>
instead of going right after them,

而是列出了周围所有的学校<br>
we made a list of every school within a hundred miles.

让那些学校先可以登录Facebook<br>
Put the Facebook on those campuses first.

很快Baylor的学生<br>
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids

看到他们朋友都在<br>
were seeing their freinds 

我们的网站上   我们也就成功了<br>
on our site and we were in.

这叫小巨角战略  好点子  Mark<br>
It's called the little big horn, it's smart, Mark.

多谢  这是我想出来的<br>
Thanks. That was mine.

-冷静点  -我俩一直在讨论<br>
\- Easy. - Hey, you know what settle an arguement for us.

我觉得应该考虑Facebook<br>
I say it's time to start 

盈利的问题了<br>
making money through the Facebook,

可Mark不想做广告<br>
Mark doesn't want to advertise.

你觉得谁对<br>
Who's right?

你们俩都不对<br>
Neither of you yet.

Facebook帅毙了  这才是重点  <br>
The Facebook is cool. That's what's that going for.

你不想让广告毁了它  因为广告太逊<br>
You don't want to ruin it with ads, because ads aren't cool.

没错<br>
Exactly.

就像你在学校参加一个特棒的晚会<br>
It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus,

但有人说11点就要结束<br>
and someone saying it's gotta be over by 11.

没错<br>
That's exactly.

你甚至不知道它究竟是什么  <br>
You don't even know what the thing is yet... 

我就是这么想的<br>
That's exactly.

会发展到什么程度  会走到多远<br>
how big it can get, how far it can go.

现在时机还不成熟<br>
This is no time to put your chips down

一百万根本不算什么  你知道多少才算数吗<br>
A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool?

是你吗<br>
You?

十亿美金<br>
A Billion dollars.

这话让我们都哑口无言<br>
It shut everybody up.

这也是你们的目标<br>
and that's what you're headed,

十亿美元市值<br>

你要走进那里<br>

告诉他们你睡过头了  来不及换衣服<br>
overslept and you didn't have time to get dressed.

他们只会根据你的公司决定要不要投资你<br>
They're gonna pitch you case equities.

他们会投资你的  他们会求着要给你钱<br>
They're gonna pitch you. They're gonna beg you to take their money.

你只要点头再点头<br>
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod and then you're

It said that we had to have a business meeting

就是那次会议Mark和Sean<br>

在公司股权上玩了复仇手段<br>

这件事给Manningham留下了极深的印象<br>

以至于他开出了更难以拒绝的投资<br>
was now making an investment offer that was hard to turn down.

I did'nt know whether to

还是该穿的像是去开会的<br>
dress for the party or the business meeting.

所以我穿了两种场合都适合的<br>
So I kind of dressed for both.

但这都不重要了<br>
But it didn't matter.

为什么<br>
Why not?

因为我被叫去既不是要开会也不是要派对<br>
