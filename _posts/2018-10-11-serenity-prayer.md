Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971)

God grant me the **serenity**<br>
to **accept** the things I cannot change;<br>
**courage** to **change** the things I can;<br>
and **wisdom** to know the difference.

Living one day at a time;<br>
enjoying one moment at a time;<br>
accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;<br>
taking, as He did, this sinful world<br>
as it is, not as I would have it;<br>
trusting that He will make all things right<br>
if I surrender to His Will;<br>
that I may be reasonably happy in this life<br>
and supremely happy with Him<br>
forever in the next.<br>
Amen.
